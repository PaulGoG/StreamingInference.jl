    AbstractWindowEstimator

A method applied to one conditioned window of a time series (a detector
score, a parameter estimate, a posterior summary, a forecast). The chain
around it — delivery, gaps, window scheduling, conditioning, calibration,
evaluation — does not depend on the method. Concrete estimators declare
their memory with [`estimator_memory`](@ref).
"""
abstract type AbstractWindowEstimator end

"""
    AbstractWindowScorer <: AbstractWindowEstimator

An estimator whose output is one scalar score per window, larger meaning
more evidence for the event class, bounded by [`score_bounds`](@ref). The
detection chain (threshold, persistence, crediting) acts on it. A scorer
implements [`window_score`](@ref).

An estimator whose output for a window depends on that window alone, so
windows may be evaluated in any order, as they complete.

An estimator that carries state from window to window (a reservoir, a
sequential posterior) and so must see the windows in content order, each
once, with every hole declared.
