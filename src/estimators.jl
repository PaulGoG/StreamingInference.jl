    AbstractWindowEstimator

A method applied to one conditioned window of a time series (a detector
score, a parameter estimate, a posterior summary, a forecast). The chain
around it — delivery, gaps, window scheduling, conditioning, calibration,
evaluation — does not depend on the method. Concrete estimators declare
their memory with [`estimator_memory`](@ref).

    AbstractWindowScorer <: AbstractWindowEstimator

An estimator whose output is one scalar score per window, larger meaning
more evidence for the event class, bounded by [`score_bounds`](@ref). The
detection chain (threshold, persistence, crediting) acts on it. A scorer
implements [`window_score`](@ref).
