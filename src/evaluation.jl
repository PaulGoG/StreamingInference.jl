        -> (threshold, info)

Decision threshold fitted on a calibration block of labels `y` and `scores`
from the event-level operating characteristic [`threshold_sweep`](@ref);
[`threshold_rows`](@ref) selects the rows of that block:

- `"far"`: the operating point of an alert trigger. A candidate is
  admissible when its false-alarm episode rate does not exceed
  `target_far_per_30d` and its window false-positive rate (the alarm
  duty cycle on unlabelled windows) does not exceed `target_fpr`. The
  candidates are scanned from the highest downwards and the threshold is
  the lowest candidate of the admissible range that starts at the top —
  the highest recall reachable while alarms remain short and isolated.
  The scan direction matters because the episode count is not monotone
  in the threshold: as the threshold falls, spurious episodes first
  multiply and then merge into a permanently raised alarm counted as a
  few long episodes, which an ascending scan would accept.
- `"fpr"`: the lowest threshold whose window false-positive rate does not
  exceed `target_fpr` (monotone, so the scan direction is immaterial).
- `"youden"`: the maximiser of `tpr - fpr` (requires both classes).

When the block holds no positive window, `"youden"` falls back to `"fpr"`
with a warning; the other criteria depend on negatives only. A block
without negatives makes every candidate admissible for `"far"` and
`"fpr"`. `info` records the criterion applied, the targets, the rates on
the fitting block at the threshold (`fit_*`), and the block size. Among
them `fit_false_alarm_episodes` is the count the fitted rate rests on:
its inverse square root is the relative error of that rate, and an
operating point placed on a handful of episodes does not transfer to
another record.
